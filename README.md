# Extract-bit-planes-from-an-Image
We are given a Grayscale Image. Since pixel value of grayscale image lies between 0 -255, so its information is contained using 8 bit. So, we can divide those image into 8 planes (8 Binary Image). Binary image are those images whose pixel value can be either 0 or 1.  So, Our task is to extract each bit planes of original image to make 8 binary image  Let particular pixel of grayscale image has value 212. So, its binary value will be 11010100. So, its 1st bit is 0, 2nd is 0, 3rd is 1, 4rth is 0, 5th is 1, 6th is 0, 7th is 1, 8th is 1. In this manner, we will take these 8 bit of all pixel and will draw 8 binary image. We have to do this to all the pixels and generate new images.
