# Extract-bit-planes-from-an-Image
We are given a Grayscale Image. Since pixel value of grayscale image lies between 0 -255, so its information is contained using 8 bit. So, we can divide those image into 8 planes (8 Binary Image). Binary image are those images whose pixel value can be either 0 or 1.
